Phorum incompatibility changes:
-------------------------------

This document describes changes between Phorum versions, which might affect
backward compatibility for third party code that was written for Phorum.


Phorum 5.2 -> Phorum 5.3:
-------------------------

  Templates
  ---------

  * Renamed template files:

    index_classic.tpl         -> index_directory.tpl
    index_new.tpl             -> index_flat.tpl


  Core code
  ---------

  * Configuration variable $PHORUM['use_new_folder_style'] was renamed to
    $PHORUM['index_style']. The old values were TRUE and FALSE. The new
    values to use are PHORUM_INDEX_DIRECTORY and PHORUM_INDEX_FLAT.

    Along with this change, the index scripts were renamed:
    include/index_classic.php -> include/index_directory.php
    include/index_new.php     -> include/index_flat.php

    And the related template files:
    index_classic.tpl         -> index_directory.tpl
    index_new.tpl             -> index_flat.tpl

    This change was done to get rid of the "new" and "classic" terminology,
    which doesn't tell new users of Phorum much. It also opens up options
    for implementing more index styles than "directory" and "flat" alone.

  * phorum_db_get_forums() previously skipped loading inactive forums and
    folders, unless PHORUM_ADMIN was defined. This function now has an
    extra argument $include_inactive, which can be used to tell specifically
    whether the inactive entries should be loaded or not.

    Some more new arguments were added to this db layer call, but those are
    backward compatible. To retrieve forums and folders from the database
    however, it is adviced to not use this db layer call anymore, but
    the API call phorum_api_forums_get() instead.

    This change was done for implementing the new Forums API code.
