Phorum Blog How-To
==================

Creating the Blog Forum
-----------------------

1. When creating the forum, you should set `Visible` to `No`.  This
   will keep it out of the normal forum list.

2. The template will use the forum's name as the title of the page.

3. Set the forum to allow only reading by anyone.


Creating a write group
----------------------

1. Go to `Edit Groups`

2. Add a group by creating a new group.  eg. Blog Writers

3. Click on the group name to edit it.

4. Add the blog forum to the group and grant `Read`, `Reply`,
   `Create New Topics`, `Edit Their Posts`

5. You can create additional groups for moderation of comments, etc.


Make a cool script (optional)
-----------------------------

Somehow, you have to point people at the blog.  You could make a redirect
using any number of things to redirect your readers to the appropriate URL
(list.php?1, where 1 is the forum id of the blog forum).  However, I like
this method.  Lets assume you want the blog to be a page called blog.php.
Create blog.php like this:

<?php

chdir("/path/to/phorum");

$PHORUM_CUSTOM_QUERY_STRING="1" // where 1 is the forum_id for the blog forum

include_once "./list.php";

?>

If you wanted your front page to be the blog, just create index.php and 
put this in it.


TODO
----

There are still several parts of the template that are not converted.
Control Center for example.
