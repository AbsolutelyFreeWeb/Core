    <para>This is the reference manual for Phorum version 5.2.x and up.
    Although a lot of information will apply, it is not intended for use with
    older versions of Phorum. We hope that this documentation will prove to be
    a useful tool for Phorum users in understanding and working with our
    software.</para>
