    <para> This section describes the Phorum upgrading process. We differentiate between three types
      of upgrades: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <xref linkend="upgrade.minorbugfix"/><sbr/> These are upgrades where only the last number in
          the Phorum version is raised (e.g. 5.2.1 to 5.2.2). These upgrades are mostly for
          implementing (security) bugfixes and minor enhancements that do not require any template
          and/or database changes.<sbr/>
          <sbr/>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <xref linkend="upgrade.minorbugfix"/><sbr/> These are upgrades where the second number in the
          Phorum version is raised (e.g. 5.1.10 to 5.2.2). These are upgrades where large new
          features are implemented. These upgrades will always require database and template changes.<sbr/>
          <sbr/>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <xref linkend="upgrade.major"/><sbr/> These are upgrades where also the first number in
          the Phorum version is raised (e.g. 3.4.8 to 5.2.2). Now and then, the Phorum team starts
          with a version of Phorum that is built from the ground up, to implement all the new
          insights and ideas that are gathered while building the previous version. Since completely
          new code is generated, the version number is raised in full. These upgrades will always
          require a full database and site layout conversion, which might implicate a lot of manual
          work. </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

      <para>The upgrading process will preserve all of your active
      settings and modules, but will overwrite hacks and any changes made to the default template
        (in the directory {phorum dir}/templates/default). Other templates will be kept intact.</para>
      <para>
      Here are the steps for upgrading:
        <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>Backup your existing Phorum5 installation. Before doing an
      upgrade, it is always wise to make a good backup of your running system. Make a backup your
        Phorum install directory and the database in which your Phorum tables are stored</listitem> 
          <listitem>Download a  newer Phorum5 package</listitem>
          <listitem> Extract the files and put them on top of the current installation</listitem>
          <listitem>Keep the database settings from {phorum dir}/include/db/config.php the same</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>
      <para> Now you can choose whether you want to upgrade from a webbrowser or from a console. </para>
      <section id="upgrade.minorbugfix.database.webbrowser">
       <title>From a webbrowser</title>

    <para> 
      Open your forum using your webbrowser. In case a database upgrade 
      is needed, you will be prompted to go to the admin page. In that case 
      open the {phorum url}/admin.php page, which will guide you through 
      the upgrade.
    </para>
     </section>
      <section id="upgrade.minorbugfix.database.console">
        <title>From a system console</title>
      
      <para>
      In the scripts directory of your Phorum installation, you will find
      the script "console_upgrade.php". Go to the scripts directory and
      execute the script from there. On most systems, you can do this using
      the following command:
      
        <screen>
          shell&gt; <literal> php console_upgrade.php</literal></screen>
      
      If you want to run this script from a different locations, then edit
      the script and update the $PHORUM_DIRECTORY variable to match the
      location of your Phorum installation.</para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="upgrade.minorbugfix.templateshacks">
      <title>Upgrading templates and hacks</title>
      <para>
      For minor upgrades, the Phorum team has the policy that templates
      should not change. For example, if you are upgrading version 5.1.1
      to 5.1.2, you can simply keep the old templates.
      </para>
      
      <para>
      Template functionality might change between major Phorum releases.
      For example, templates that were made for Phorum 5.0.x are not
      compatible with the templates for Phorum 5.1.x. So to upgrade these,
      you'll have to build new templates, based on the new default template
      that is included in the distribution. Simply copying the old template
      will most probably result in errors and missing functionality.
      </para>
      <para>
      If you are doing a minor upgrade and you have to preserve changes that
      were made to the default template (which is not the recommended way
      of customizing Phorum, see creating_templates.txt), you can follow one
      of the following options:
      <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>Extract the new Phorum distribution to its own directory and reapply 
        your changes before putting it over the existing installation</listitem>
      
        <listitem>Create a backup of your existing installation. Install the new
      distribution on top of the old one and reapply the changes to 
        the new version while it is "live"</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <title>Upgrade preparations</title>
      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>Download and unpack the Phorum5 package;</listitem>

          <listitem>Follow the installation instructions in <xref linkend="installation.main"/>.
            Install Phorum5 into a new directory. </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="upgrade.major.convert">
      <title>Convert the old forum data</title>
      <para> In the scripts directory of your Phorum5 distribution, you will find a script named
        phorum3to5convert.php. Instructions for using this script can be found at the top of this
        script itself. The script will convert your old forum to Phorum5. Everything, but permission
        levels, is converted. </para>
    </section>
    <section id="upgrade.major.convert">
      <title>Update the posted message counters for the users</title>
      <para> In the scripts directory, you will also find a script named "update_postcount.php".
        This script can be used to update the number of posts for users to the right value. So if
        you want correct numbers to show up in the user profiles, just run this script once AFTER
        the conversion has been completed. To run it, you will have to copy it over to the main
        Phorum5 directory. After that you can either run it from the command line or by opening it
        from your webbrowser. See also the instructions in the script itself. </para>
