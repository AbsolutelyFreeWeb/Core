      <title>What are Virtual Roots?</title>
    <para>
      Virtual Roots allow you to run "a phorum inside a phorum".
      It makes the selected folder to the "root folder" of all forums and folders below it which means that the "forum-list" links go as far up as to this folder and searches for "all forums"
      are limited to forums in this virtual root. The announcement-module has also functions to use a different forum per virtual root for the announcements.
      On the other hand, the administration-page is about all the forums/folders and users are valid about all forums (in all virtual roots) in the installation.

       <title>How do I create a virtual root?</title>
       <para>
      To create a virtual root just create a folder and select the checkbox "Virtual Root for descending forums/folders" for this folder.
      From now on every folder or forum below this folder will be contained in this virtual root.

      <title>What are Phorum Modules?</title>
      <para>
        Modules are (often) small extensions to Phorum-functionality without sacrificing performance of the Phorum-core.
        You can install them if needed for using their functionalities.<sbr/>
        Take a look at the <ulink url="http://trac.phorum.org/wiki/ListOfModules">Modules-List</ulink> to see the currently available modules.

    <section id="features.modules.installation">
      <title>How do I install a module?</title>
      <para>
        All modules are installed inside the subdirectory "mods" of your
        Phorum installation directory. There are two types of modules:
        single file and multi file modules.
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            Single file modules
            <para>
              Single file modules consist of a single php-file containing also the description and hook-names.
              These kind of modules can't have a settings-page.<sbr/>
              You install a single file module by simply dropping its php-file into the mods directory and enabling it in the administration pages.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            Multi file modules
            <para>
              Multi file modules consist of at least a directory with a php-file named the same as the directory and an info.txt-file.
              Additionally for a settings-page there needs to be a settings.php. Beside these standard-files there can be all kind of
              files and directories used for the module's functions.<sbr/>
              You install a multi-file module by copying the whole directory (preserving its directory structure) into the mods-directory
              and enabling it in the admin.

    <title>Announcements (Module)</title>
    <section id="features.announcements.intro">
      <title>What are announcements?</title>
      <para>
        Announcements are important messages shown to all users and on all (or specified) pages which should stand out over the regular posts.<sbr/>
      Since Phorum-5.2 announcements are handled as a module which is distributed with Phorum. See <xref linkend="features.modules"/> for generic module instructions.
      The module allows for better separation of posts and announcements and also some additional features like hiding announcements after a given time and it opens
      the way for other future announcements modules which offer even more functionalities.
      </para>

    <section id="features.announcements.howto">
      <title>How do I use announcements?</title>
      <para>
        The announcement-module works with a separate announcements-forum whose messages are shown above the message-list as specified.
        Therefore follow this description to enable announcements for your Phorum:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>Create a separate announcement-forum. The name doesn't matter, just try to remember it.</listitem>
          <listitem>Go to the Admin -> Modules panel and click on the "Settings" link of the announcements-module.</listitem>
          <listitem>Select the pages where announcements should be visible on (index, list and/or read)</listitem>
          <listitem>Select if only unread announcements should be shown to the user<sbr/><emphasis role="bold">Note: Only announcements the user has clicked on to read the message are counted as read.</emphasis></listitem>
          <listitem>Enter the number of announcements that should be shown.<sbr/><emphasis role="bold">Attention: This number of announcements is all that is retrieved before doing the additional checks like for date and being new to the user.</emphasis></listitem>
          <listitem>Enter the maximum number of days an announcement should be visible for.<sbr/><emphasis role="bold">Note: The post-date is being used to calculate that. Edits are not taken into account.</emphasis></listitem>          
          <listitem>Select the announcement forum where the messages should be taken from</listitem>
          <listitem>Optional: If you have vroots then these will be listed and you have the chance to select different announcement forums for them.</listitem>
