   To post, reply and subscribe to topics, and to personalise user 
   settings through the Control Panel, you have to create a user 
   profile. The possible exception to this rule is if the forum 
   administrator allows anonymous posting in certain forums, in which 
   case you do not need to register to post topics or reply to them. 
   However, in most cases at least the majority of forums require 
   creating a user profile to perform these actions.
