This directory holds the source files for the Phorum JavaScript library.
The Makefile will concatenate all the source files in this directory
and store the output in ../phorum-javascript-library.php

The numeric prefix that is used for the source files can be used to
make sure that the files get added to the final library script in
the correct order.
