Changelog:
----------

- Rewrite for Phorum 5.2. Changes are:
  - Added Phorum copyright notices;
  - Cleaned up the settings screen by moving explanations to help balloons;
  - Added settings for configuring the BBcode tags that are allowed, so
    admins can disable unwanted tags;
  - Added support for adding Editor Tools module buttons, directly from
    the bbcode module (so the Editor Tools module can be stripped down
    to only be the core of the tool bar functionality, while modules can
    add buttons to it);
  - Fixed a quote bug. Before, [quote wrong quote[/quote] would render
    as an unclosed <blockquote><div>;
  - Fixed detection of mail addresses for cases where the email address
    is at the end of a line.
  - Got rid of the 5 char random marker that was used in URL detection.
    5 random chars from a hex md5 sum is too dangerous (it could
    return a part of a URL and that could explain some sporadic bug reports
    that I got from my users about URLs not always working correctly).
  - The terms "bb code", "bb_code" and "bbcode" were all in use. Reduced
    that to only use "bbcode".

- Checkboxes added for "links in window" and "anti-spam tags"
