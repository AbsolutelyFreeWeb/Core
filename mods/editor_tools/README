Module  : Phorum Editor Tools 
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module will add a buttonbar to the Phorum message editor, which can be
used by visitors to easily apply BBcode and smileys to their postings.

Other modules can add extra buttons to the buttonbar through an easy to
use API. See the API functions at the bottom of editor_tools.php for
the documentation.

Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "editor_tools" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Editor Tools".

- Enable the "BBcode" and/or "Smileys" module (Editor Tools will
  only show tools for the enabled modules, so if you do not enable
  any of these two, no tools will be displayed at all).


Color picker information:
-------------------------

For the color picker, we use the excellent script from dhtmlgoodies.com.
The script does need some changes to make it work for the editor tools.
These are the changes that are needed:

1) Delete form{ padding-left:5px; } from the css file.

2) In js_color_picker_v2.js, change all references like 'images/...'
   to './mods/editor_tools/colorpicker/images/...'

3) In js_color_picker_v2.js, change the action functions
   chooseColor() and chooseColorSlider() to call the function
   editor_tools_handle_color_select() with the selected color
   as the argument.

4) In js_color_picker_v2.js, add the call
   editor_tools_register_popup_object(color_picker_div);
   after creating the color_picker_div in the function showColorPicker().

5) In the same function, right after the code block for if(!color_picker_div),
   the color picker can be made visible by settings style.display to block.
   Together with that call, the call for closing all popups must be made,
   so change the code to this:
   {editor_tools_hide_all_popups(); color_picker_div.style.display='block';}

6) Eye candy: change all #317802 in the js_color_picker_v2.css to #777.
