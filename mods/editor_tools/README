Module  : Phorum Editor Tools 
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module will add a buttonbar to the Phorum message editor, which can be
used by visitors to easily apply BBcode and smileys to their postings.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "editor_tools" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Editor Tools".


Color picker:
-------------

For the color picker, we use the excellent script from dhtmlgoodies.com.
The script does need some changes to make it work for the editor tools.
These are the changes that are needed:

1) Delete form{ padding-left:5px; } from the css file.

2) In js_color_picker_v2.js, change all references like 'images/...'
   to './mods/editor_tools/colorpicker/images/...'

3) In js_color_picker_v2.js, change the action functions
   chooseColor() and chooseColorSlider() to call the function
   editor_tools_handle_color_select() with the selected color
   as the argument.
