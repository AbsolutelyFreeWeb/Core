Changelog:
----------

2006-07-20 v1.1.8

   - Added extra languages to the distribution:
     * Finnish (by Panu)
     * German (by Thomas Seifert)
     Thank you guys, for the translations!

   - Some more fixes for running in a portable / embedded setup.
     * The smileys are now visible in the popup window.
     * When registering editor tools from another module, their
       icon and jslib paths are resolved automatically to an
       absolute URL.

   - Some small changes to the help files.

   - Just http:// is no longer accepted for URL and image links.

2006-07-19 v1.1.7

   - Improved right justification of the help popup in some
     browsers.

   - Various fixes to make the module work correctly in a
     portable / embedded setup.

2006-07-18 v1.1.6

   - Added a z-index CSS property for the popups with a high value,
     to prevent them from popping up behind other page elements.

   - Changed all css classnames and javascript ids to not contain
     any underscores (thanks to Brian for the hint and pointer to
     http://www.htmlite.com/CSS003a.php).

   - Changed ".editor-tools-button" in the css to the more specific
     "#editor-tools .editor-tools-button", because it wasn't 
     rendered correctly in some cases.

   - Fixes for color picker CSS in XHTML transitional pages
     viewed within MSIE. The tabs would not show up correctly
     without this fix (extra padding and top bar too small).
     Remark: this makes the tabs a bit off in XHTML strict
     pages. But since Phorum templates are XHTML transitional
     by default, I put this fix in the default package.

2006-07-17 v1.1.5

   - For MSIE, the active textarea selection is now stored before
     opening the color or text size popup and restored after
     a selection has been made. This is done, because MSIE looses
     the selection range when focus moves to another object.
     This caused for example the color code to be never around
     the selected text in MSIE.

2006-07-17 v1.1.4

   - Changed vertical aligment for the subject smiley button.

   - Bounding whitespace is now ignored when applying some bbcode
     to a selection. So instead of "this is [b]bold [/b] code"
     it will be "this is [b]bold[/b] code". Thanks to Milos for 
     the idea.

   - Improved detection for checking if we are running on a page,
     containing an editor. The existing detection had a bug that
     caused a javascript warning about a missing textarea on
     posting confirmation and error pages. Thanks to Milos for
     pointing me at this problem.

2006-07-16 v1.1.3

   - Some small changes to make it easier to override and extend the
     editor tools from another module.

2006-07-15 v1.1.2

   - Added a popup for subject smileys. This one is disabled by default,
     so if you want this, enable subject smileys in the module settings.

   - Added a module settings screen. Here the administrator can configure
     which tools are enabled (bbcode, smileys, subject smileys and help).
     In case the bbcode module is enabled, you get extra fields to configure
     which bbcode tags (bold, italic, etc) are put in the editor tools.
    
   - Some small bugfixes.

2006-07-14 v1.1.1

    - Tool icon sizes are now explicitly set, for smoother loading.

2006-07-13 v1.1.0

    - Initial release.
