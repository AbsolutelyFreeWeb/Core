Changelog:
----------

2006-07-16 v1.1.3

   - Some small changes to make it easier to override and extend the
     editor tools from another module.

2006-07-15 v1.1.2

   - Added a popup for subject smileys. This one is disabled by default,
     so if you want this, enable subject smileys in the module settings.

   - Added a module settings screen. Here the administrator can configure
     which tools are enabled (bbcode, smileys, subject smileys and help).
     In case the bbcode module is enabled, you get extra fields to configure
     which bbcode tags (bold, italic, etc) are put in the editor tools.
    
   - Some small bugfixes.

    - Initial release.
